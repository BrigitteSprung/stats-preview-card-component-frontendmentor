## My process

1. First I created my repository and connected it GitHub pages
2. I started a timer on Toggl to see how long this project will take me
3. I had a look at the designs to plan my process
4. I created the structure of the html file
5. Then a whole bunch of css to see how things work
6. There was a lot of back and forth trying to get things to fit nicely
7. And then redoing a lot for mobile


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a lot more about custom CSS properties and flexbox. I still don't think I got things as responsive as I'd like, so I might revisit this project. It was also good practice in using Emmet for speeding up typing. Overall it was a good experience trying to recreate something. 

Some cool code snippets, see below:

CSS Custom Properties
```css
:root {
 --ff-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;
 --ff-secondary: 'Lexend Deca', sans-serif;

 --clr-main: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
 --clr-card: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
 --clr-accent:  hsl(277, 64%, 61%);

 --clr-text: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

 --fs-copy: 15px;
 --fs-heading: 40px;

 --fw-reg: 400;
 --fw-bold: 700;
}
```

Reording items in flexbox
```css
.image-container {
        order: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to practice flexbox a bit more and perhaps try this project again but using Grid this time. Essentially just learning to style pages quicker and more effeciently.
